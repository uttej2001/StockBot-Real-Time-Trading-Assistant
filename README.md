# StockBot-Real-Time-Trading-Assistant
Reinforcement Learning Course Project
We've developed a cutting-edge Stock Trading bot leveraging real-time closing price data. Our experiment compared four distinct agents: Policy Gradient, Q-learning, Moving Average, and Actor Critic. Stay tuned as we harness the power of the best model to create an automated trading application with real-time stock data which gives us the maximum reward points and profits by trading the initial starting amount assigned to the trading bot in least amount of time.
